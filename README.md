# Open-Source-Requests

I would love to open source pretty much any of my tools if there is demand for it. 

## Requests

If you would like me to open source one of my tools, please **create an issue on this repo** with a link to the tool! It can be as simple as this
```
title: Please open source XYZ
description: This is a link to the project: https://example.com
```
Once I can, I'll reply to the issue with a link to the newly created repository.

## Why would I need to request open source?

I'm an advocate for [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and [Libre Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement), but after a decade of development I've come to see that putting things on Github is not the same as open sourcing a project. Open source requires **vision**, **commitment**, **marketing**, **leadership**, and **community**, which are all qualities that are difficult to manifest and maintain. 

The maintainers of [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/), who I admire, have taken a very mature position on the subject in their [decision to not open source](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/open-sourcing-of-obsidian/1515/11) the core functionality in their product. While they value open source, and intend to eventually make the source available, "Open source requires a lot of extra effort, and the developers would rather put that effort into the app itself.[1]"

I've come to agree with that on a variety of levels. The user is the most important part of any product. Since I'm the only user for a lot of my tools (and certainly the only maintainer), it makes a lot more sense to spend my limited time on the features that I personally care about the most. In order to move fast on several projects at once, I keep the source for most of my projects in a single private repo. If there is any demand at all for open sourcing a project, I can migrate the source code for it to a newly created, public repo.
